2. Create a program that adds two integers
See if you can create a C++ program that takes two integers and adds them together. The result should return the sum. While this may be a rudimentary calculator, imagine its power in a large database where you could use loops to add massive quantities of data very meticulously.

Bonus challenge: Expand on this program to add two columns of a matrix to produce an array of the summed elements.

If you’re interested in working in the financial industry as a developer, you’ll use programs like this to help your company calculate its figures.
